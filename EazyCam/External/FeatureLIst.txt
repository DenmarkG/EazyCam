Eazy Cam
- 3rd person orbit with customizable controls (EzOrbitCam)
	- ability to update in edit mode, and save runtime changes
	- targetting
	- zooming

- 3rd Person static angle cam (EzSimpleCam)
	- follows player from specific angle (MOBA style)
	- same customizations

- 3rd person static (EzStaticCam)
	- security cam style
	
- Triggerable forced angle with all cameras, for more cinematic views
	- should allow for no code needed by the end user
- custom inspector for cameras
- demo scenes for exhibition/testing each camera
- platform independent


Current bugs:
- Camera snaps to default position after entering orbit, if targetting was entered previously [fixed]
- Camera jitters and does not return to proper distance when occluded by round objects or when moving while occluded (as in when moving on a floor)

TODO:
- update input per component
- move collision code to it's own component
