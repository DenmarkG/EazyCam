Eazy Camera Readme


To set up the Eazy Camera system:
1) Add the EazyCam component to a camera in the scene, or drang and drop the EazyCam prefab into an existing scene.
2) From here you can adjust any values in the EzCameraSettings object to fine tune your camera, and the inspector on the camera to customize the functionality.

Done! Your Eazy Camera system is now ready to use.
